 ascend quicker and more exciting.

 * Dont let enemies hit you, or you will pay the price.
  Enemies will spawn during your climb to try and stop you.
 * You can use only fight back enemies if you have the right equipment.
  equipments will spawn during the gamem and the player must touch them to obtain. They can be used to fight back and remove enemies from your path.

|Inner conflicts|Shoot for the Sky is a fast paced game. The player must make split second decisions on a regular basis. What platform should you aim to? Should you try and dodge the enemy or try and take it down but waste precious ammo in the proccess? You must choose fast as every second is valuable.



### 7. Borders


Shoot for the Sky is a continuous scrolling game, where the lower border of the game "chases" the player and the upper border of the game is virtually infinite.
The horizontal borders of the game are constant and immovable.

The player is exposed to the borders right away as he cannot move beyond the horizontal borders.
The bottom border keep chasing him, and the upper border is the sky!

The game map is generated in real time as the player climbs. By the nature of climbing games, there is only one way to go which is up.


### 8. Results


What makes the game interesting is the motivation to score as much as possible, which gives the game a big replayability value.
That means, that essentialy there are infinite amount of results.

The result of a game session is mostly skills but has a small factor of luck.
Because the platforms, powerups and equipment are uniquely generated each session, the game layout is different every time.

The game is a complex type of game, where the player battles against the game rules by himself.

לפני שמתחילים לעבוד על משחק (או כל מוצר אחר), חשוב לוודא שלא עשו את זה קודם. לא נעים לעבוד סמסטר שלם (או שנה שלמה) על משחק ואז לגלות שכבר יש משחק כזה. 

חפשו בגוגל, בחנות play, בפייסבוק, ובכל מקום אחר שיש לכם גישה אליו, משחקים דומים לרעיון שלכם. ציינו באיזה ביטויי-חיפוש השתמשתם.

זהו את שלושת המשחקים הדומים ביותר. לגבי כל אחד מהם:

* שימו קישור וצילום-מסך להמחשה.
* הסבירו מה תעשו כדי שהמשחק שלכם יהיה שונה/מקורי/מיוחד/טוב יותר מהמתחרים?  מדוע שחקנים יעדיפו דווקא את המשחק שלכם?

מבין הרכיבים הרשמיים, 
איזה רכיב (או רכיבים) ידגיש ביותר את הייחוד והמקוריות של המשחק שלכם, לעומת משחקים דומים הקיימים בשוק?
